# To begin I saw that in order to list my code in columns I had to first attach it to a string. In order to do this I had to use pd.read_csv in order to read it. After I had the string with the columns and list I had to print it to out in order to demonstrate the data. The data I found was from the federal reserve talking about paper intrest rates. When I found this I downloaded and put it into the folder I had already and attached the name. 

#Quantative-Data: I picked this dataset on test grades because I wanted to see the average grades that a kid in my grade would get since it was interesting to me, then I picked reading because it is one of my worst topics in school and I thought it would fun to check other peopels grades. I learned that the average was barely a passing grade in this dataset which I found interesting since there were many outliers in this dataset which gave me the thought for it to be higher.
