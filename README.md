# To begin I saw that in order to list my code in columns I had to first attach it to a string. In order to do this I had to use pd.read_csv in order to read it. After I had the string with the columns and list I had to print it to out in order to demonstrate the data. The data I found was from the federal reserve talking about paper intrest rates. When I found this I downloaded and put it into the folder I had already and attached the name.
